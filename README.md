# Algorithms, TypeScript and Testing

Practicing algorithms with typescript and unit tests.

- Methods of solving algorithms have it's own folder inside of a dist folder
- Files inside this folder have a commented description of a problem and a solution
- I used jest library for unit tests that test algorithms
- Tests are located inside test folder with <problem_name>/test.ts
